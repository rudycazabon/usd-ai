# USD AI 
The contents of this repository are a collection of OpenUSD tools that interface with MCP (modelcontextprotocol) and A2A (agent2agent). The goal of this effort is to give large language models and agentic workflows the tools to work directly with OpenUSD objects, e.g., UsdStage, prims, hierarchies, and others and integrate them into comprehensive asset creation workflows.
